# **Nullbind-Windows11-AutoHotKey**

A **universal null-bind script** for **Windows 11** built with **AutoHotKey (AHK)**.
Designed for gamers, power users, and productivity setups that need a safe “do-nothing” hotkey or a way to intercept inputs without triggering default Windows or in-game actions.

---

## 🧩 **What This Does**

This script creates a **null bind** hotkey that intercepts keystrokes or mouse inputs and discards them — meaning the key press performs no action at all.
Perfect for:

* Creating **safe placeholder hotkeys**.
* Preventing accidental input from performing system actions.
* Configuring **universal dummy binds** in games or automation setups.

---

## ⚙️ **Features**

* Written entirely in **AutoHotKey** — lightweight, no dependencies.
* Compatible with **Windows 11**.
* Easy to edit — customize which keys or buttons are null-bound.
* Minimal resource usage; runs silently in the tray.

---

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

1. Install [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/).
2. Download this repository and open `nullbind.ahk`.
3. Double-click the script to run it.
4. To stop the script, right-click the green **H** tray icon → **Exit**.

---

## 💡 **Example Usage**

```ahk
; Example null bind for Caps Lock
CapsLock::Return

; Example null bind for Mouse Button 5
XButton2::Return
```

You can add or remove lines as needed to match your device layout or preferences.

---

## 🧠 **Customization**

Open `nullbind.ahk` in any text editor (Notepad, VS Code, etc.) and edit the key mappings.
Each hotkey line follows the pattern:

```
<Key>::Return
```

For example:

* `CapsLock::Return` → disables Caps Lock.
* `XButton2::Return` → disables your mouse side button.

You can map any key combination supported by AutoHotKey (e.g., `Ctrl + Q`, `Alt + 1`, `F13`, etc.).

---

## ⚙️ **Notes**

* Works globally across all Windows apps.
* Uses negligible CPU and memory.
* Start minimized or add to your Windows Startup folder for persistent use.

# **ScrollSpeedAdjuster-Windows11-AutoHotKey**

A **lightweight AutoHotKey script** that lets you dynamically change your **system-wide mouse scroll speed** on Windows 11 using customizable hotkeys.
Perfect for users who need precise scroll control across browsers, code editors, spreadsheets, or games.

---

## 🧩 **What This Does**

This script directly adjusts the Windows scroll-wheel sensitivity via system parameters.
It cycles between four customizable scroll-speed presets, allowing instant switching between slow, medium, and fast profiles.

---

## ⚙️ **Features**

* Written in pure AutoHotKey — no dependencies.
* Four scroll-speed presets (default: 5, 12, 18, 25).
* Cycle or reset instantly with hotkeys.
* Works globally across all Windows 11 apps.
* Lightweight — runs silently in the background.
* Tray notifications display current scroll speed.

---

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

1. Install [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/).
2. Download this repository and open `ScrollSpeedAdjuster-Windows11-AutoHotKey.ahk`.
3. Double-click the script to run it.
4. Use **F19** to cycle through scroll speeds *(5 → 12 → 18 → 25 → 5)*.
5. Press **F20** to instantly reset the scroll speed to **5 lines per notch**.
6. Right-click the green **H** tray icon → **Exit** to close the script.

## 🖱️ **Razer Synapse Integration**

This script is pre-mapped for **Razer Synapse** users — for example, with a **Razer DeathAdder V2 X Hyperspeed** or similar mouse.

In Razer Synapse → assign:

* **F19** → *Upper side button* (formerly Mouse Button 5)
* **F20** → *Lower side button* (formerly Mouse Button 4)

These function keys are generated by Synapse (they don’t exist on standard keyboards), letting AutoHotKey detect the side-buttons safely without conflicting with Windows inputs.

If you use Logitech G Hub, Corsair iCUE, or another tool, just map any two spare buttons to **F19/F20** — or edit the script for custom keys.

---

## 🧠 **Customization**

You can open the `.ahk` file in Notepad or any text editor to adjust:

* **Hotkeys** used for cycling/resetting scroll speed.
* **Preset values** for scroll sensitivity.

Default configuration:

```ahk
; Preset values
presetValues := [5, 12, 18, 25]

; Hotkeys
F19::CycleScrollPresets()
F20::SetScrollLines(5)
```
